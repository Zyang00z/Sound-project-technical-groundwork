# Sound-project-technical-groundwork

## Overview
This repository contains a foundational codebase for an experimental sound program developed using P5.js and Tone.js libraries. The main feature of this program is the creation of a user interface with visual controls that allow for the adjustment of audio effects in real-time and facilitate the reproduction of sound files provided by the user.

## Features
- **File Input Buttons**: Users can load their sound files into the program using file input buttons, enhancing the interactivity of the sound program.
- **Play/Pause Control**: A dedicated button is provided to play or pause the sound, giving the user control over the audio playback.
- **Audio Effect Sliders**: Two sliders are present to adjust the pitch and frequency effects of the sound file, offering a hands-on experience in sound manipulation.

## Customization
The project steps beyond the standard examples provided by p5.js, featuring creatively customized buttons. These include aesthetic and functional variations from the typical button with labeled text, providing a unique and engaging user interface.
